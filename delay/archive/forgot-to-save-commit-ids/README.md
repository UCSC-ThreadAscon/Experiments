These experiments are good. However, I forgot to confirm that they were
using specific versions of ESP-IDF and OpenThread that I will use for the experiments.

As a result, I am archiving them and rerunning new experiments, where I can
confirm that they are all using the same version of ESP-IDF and OpenThread.
